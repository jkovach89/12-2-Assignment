-What is the goal of EDA (exploratory data analysis)?

EDA is the process of exploring a new data set with the goal of discovering new trends, insights, and patterns for use in the subsequent modeling.

-Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. Each review is scored as a Likert-style survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's website. 

a. What problems do you expect to find in the raw data?

I expect bias toward negative sentiment because people who are displeased with the product are more likely to review it. If the survey is set up with response validation, format shouldn't be a concern, however, if there is an open text field, text may have to be cleaned up.

b. If your task is to build features that give information about customer sentiments, how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it? 

I would try to collect data in a way that was non-intrusive and automatically relayed outputs based on user input. Where I asked for customer input I would attempt to allow for passive collection of data to validate the customer input. For instance, if I asked the customer to rate the product, I might also be collecting data on errors the customer encountered as well, in order to see if there were correlation between negative reviews and user error.

c. Try to identify some potentially useful features that you might derive from the raw data. How would you derive them and how would you assess the usefulness of those features?
