Research Proposal

Sith Lords Amended

Problem: Poor Recruiting Numbers
Specific Scope: Slogan is believed to be ineffective

Potential solution: "Together we can rule the galaxy" as a slogan will yield more recruits

Design: two groups, consisting of both captured droids and free droids will be introduced to a video message of emperor palpatine reading one or the other slogan and polled for desire to join the dark side. Repeat sampling three times and calculate numbers from each slogan. If one slogan yield a recruitment turnout of Â± 10% above the other, slogan will be deemed to be considered superior and deployed immediately.
