1. Sith Lords
-The first problem I see here is that each of the sith lords is delivering the message. The 'droids' (or people) hearing this message should hear the same message, including voice inflection and tone. Also, because palpatine can deliver the message face to face whereas darth vader is hidden behind a mask, there is bias in the delivery and because the droids are captured droids (and likely angry), the anger message may resonate more with them. I would correct the study by having palpatine record his delivery of each catch phrase and play it for the respective group randomly consisting of both free and captured droids.

2. Jedi PR
-If the Jedi ever pick jar jar as their representative, we riot. Have questions.

3. Job Satisfaction
-Location is the lurking factor here. HR workers in the over-represented countries are more likely to sway the total satisfaction rate. Ideally, you segment the numbers by country.

4. Fitness Tracker
-People with low physical activity are less likely to opt into a study on their level of physical activity. Correct by collecting data from all users.

5. Test Versioning
-The first and last students to arrive could be more anxious (assuming the test was over a very limited time), or students may test better in the middle of the day than at the beginning or end (assuming time of day differences). Control by issuing the test over three consecutive days at the same time or all at once.
